# Phish-Guard: Gmail Email Phishing Detection Extension

## Overview
Phish-Guard is a Chrome extension designed to enhance Gmail security by analyzing emails in real-time and providing users with clear reports about potential phishing threats.

## Purpose
The main goal of Phish-Guard is to protect Gmail users by detecting and flagging suspicious emails using well-defined indicators such as phishing phrases, unsafe links, and untrusted senders.

## Key Features
- Real-time email analysis within Gmail.
- Visual alerts indicating phishing risk levels.
- Integration with Google Safe Browsing API.
- Simple and intuitive interface for non-technical users.

## How It Works
1. **Monitoring** â€“ Listens for when a Gmail email is opened.
2. **Data Extraction** â€“ Collects sender, subject, body, links, and attachments.
3. **Risk Analysis** â€“ Calculates a phishing risk score (0â€“100) based on:
   - Phishing-related keywords.
   - Link safety (via Google Safe Browsing).
   - Sender domain trust level.
   - Suspicious attachments (.exe, .bat, etc.).
4. **Reporting** â€“ Displays colored alerts with risk score and findings:
   - ðŸŸ¥ High Risk (score â‰¥ 70): Red warning box with details.
   - ðŸŸ§ Medium Risk (30 â‰¤ score < 70): Orange caution box.
   - ðŸŸ© Low Risk (score < 30): Green confirmation box with optional report button.

## Risk Scoring Breakdown

|----------------------|--------|-------------|
| Phishing Phrases     | 40%    | Looks for keywords like "verify your account" or "urgent action required". |
| Suspicious Links     | 30%    | Uses Google Safe Browsing to check links. |
| Untrusted Sender     | 20%    | Evaluates the sender's domain trust level. |
| Dangerous Attachments| 10%    | Flags .exe, .bat, .vbs files, etc. |
